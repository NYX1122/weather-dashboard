# weather-dashboard
## Displays weather based on what city the user searches for, which includes current weather in said city and five days into the future.
## Does this by utilizing two public apis, Openweathermap and Positionstack. The latter was used for retrieving geocode data for cities.
## I also utilized bootstrap solely for styling and jquery for much of the logic.
